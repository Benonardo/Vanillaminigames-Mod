A minecraft mod with insiders from the VanillaMinigames server. You can join their discord [here](https://discord.gg/58Pk9q6rBY) if you want.

This is mostly a fun project and not a mod with great features. If you came here because of minigames in the name, you can visit the minecraft server "VanillaMinigames.eu" for funny games made all without plugins or mods!
